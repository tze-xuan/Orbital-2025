We are Year 1 Business Analytics Undergraduates who are also cafe-enthusiasts! As avid cafe-hoppers, we are well-versed in the subculture of 'cafe-hopping', and as such, are aware of the needs and problems faced by fellow cafe-goers. We were hence driven to create a platform that can address all of our needs, whilst maintaining the 'aesthetics and vibes' of cafe-hopping. 

Some of the struggles we have faced in our cafe-hopping experiences include discovering new cafes or cafes with a suitable environment catered to our plans (socialising or studying) and budget. This has sparked our interest in developing 'Cafe Chronicles' that will relieve those difficulties we believe other cafe-goers have also experienced. Hence, we were motivated to engage fellow cafe-goers in a fun cafe adventure that weaves a closely-knitted community, creating a more convenient and accessible cafe hopping culture.
